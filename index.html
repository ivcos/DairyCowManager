        FarMAI is the first Smart Dairy System that does not depend spending money on expensive hardware. Our application is
        the first that is based on data. Our algorithms are based on the data that is collected from the farmer.
        So the insights devleoped are on an individual Farm basis  not on region or country based. 

        The complete Dairy Management system that provides the farmer with the average running cost per cow
        and the average income per cow. This application will also provide the farmer with the average profit
        per cow. Helping the farmer to make better decisions on the farm.

        <h2>Cow Health</h2>
        <p>
            Having all the information about the cows health in one place will help the farmer to make better but 
            also provide better care of the cows. The farmer will be able to see the cows health history and 
            administer the correct medication to the cow and take the correct action to help the cow. 
        </p>
        <h2>Cow Profit Monitor</h2>
        <p>
            With all the inputs available, the cows are rated on their performance. At the ned of the year, our application
            makes the decision easier for the farmer. The farmer will be able to see which cows are making a profit and which
        </p>
        <h2>External Inputs</h2>
        <p>
            Our tool also takes external information into account. Initially, we will be using the weather forecast to help the farmer
            make better decisions. The weather forecast will be used to help the farmer decide when to feed the cows and when to milk the cows. 
            But also will be used to alert the farmer of any potential weather hazards that may affect the cows. 
            
            If the farmer has installed a local weather station that picks up ground conditions in real-time; i.e hoose.
            In addition drop in milk production will be detected on a per milking basis.
