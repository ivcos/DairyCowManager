          Farmers are suffering from data overload and feel a lack of control of their data. The
          FarMAI is the first tool that give control back to the farmer. The
          farmer owns the <em>data</em> about their herd, <em>data</em> about
          their land, <em>data</em> about their farm practices, <em>about the time they work on the farm</em>
          <em>data</em> about the way the farmer protects the environment.  The farmer can use this
          <em>data</em> to show the consumer that they as custodians of the
          environment are taking care of the environment, their naimals and
          providing the consumer with a quality product. While also providing a
          livelihood for the farmer and their family.
        </p>

        <p>
          FarMAI is the first Smart Dairy Management System that does not
          require spending money on expensive hardware. Our application is the
          first that is based on data. <br />

          Our algorithms are based on the data that is collected from the
          farmer, real-time data from sensors on the farm and external data
          sources. The insights devleoped are on an individual Farm basis not on
          region or country based. FarMAI provides the farmer with the average
          running cost per cow and the average income per cow. This application
          will also provide the farmer with the average profit per cow. Helping
          the farmer to make better decisions on the farm.
        </p>
        <h2>Herd Management</h2>
        <div class="home-page-flexbox">
          <p>
            Having all the information about the cows health in one place will
            help the farmer to make better but also provide better care of the
            cows. The farmer will be able to see the cows health history and
            administer the correct medication to the cow and take the correct
            action to help the cow.

        <h3>Cow Profit Monitor</h3>
        <div class="home-page-flexbox">
        <p>
          With all the inputs available, the cows are rated on their
          performance. On a continual basis, our application makes the decision
          easier for the farmer. The farmer will be able to see which cows are
          making a profit and which

        <h2>AgriIoT</h2>
        <p>
          Our tool also takes external information into account. Initially, we
          will be using the weather forecast to help the farmer make better
          decisions. The weather forecast will be used to help the farmer decide
          when to feed the cows and when to milk the cows. But also will be used
          to alert the farmer of any potential weather hazards that may affect
          the cows. If the farmer has installed a local weather station that
          picks up ground conditions in real-time; i.e hoose. In addition drop
          in milk production will be detected on a per milking basis.
        </p>
        <h2>Farm Alerts</h2>
            <p>Farmers are notified in real-time of events based on:
            <ul>
                <li>Weather</li>
                <li>Animal Health</li>
                <li>Animal Performance</li>
                <li>Risk of Hoose</li>
                <li>Animal Feed</li>
                <li>Animal Winter Fodder</li>
                <li>Animal Milk Production</li>
                <li>Animal Slurry Levels</li>
                <li>On Farm Weather Conditions</li>
            </p>
        <h2>Slurry Management</h2>
        <p>
          Slurry Management is important for every farmer. The FarMAI
          application will help the farmer to manage the slurry on the farm. The
          farmer will be able to see the slurry levels in the tanks and will be
          alerted when the slurry levels are too high. Included are;

        <h2>Winter Fodder Management</h2>
        <p>Farmers should complete a winter fodder budget to evaluate the silage in the
            yard compared to the silage required for the winter. When completing the winter fodder
            budget, it is important to give a buffer of 4 to 6 weeks in case of early winter or late turnout
